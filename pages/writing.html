            <h3 class="workContent">Hairlines, Holidays, and Big Questions</h3>
            <article class="workContent">
Immigrants are like rats. You might go days without encountering us - years if you’re not in the city - but once you do, you know there are more close by. Our magnetic poles seem to pull us towards each other and sometimes, it seems, slightly repel the locals.

That’s the phenomenon that brought me to a practically 100% immigrant New Year’s Eve party on the last night of 2018.

Clara, AKA Svetlana, had lived with my partner, David, for years. Like all the best roommates, she was frequently absent for days at a time, traveling the world as a flight attendant for EuroAir. She and David generally got along well; his overwhelming desire for a clean, ordered, and relaxing apartment meshed well with her need to sleep for twenty hours at a time after a transcontinental flight. When she finally woke up, she’d regale him with tales of absurd passenger requests and the latest feuds amongst the flight crew. He’d share the latest stories of incompetence of his nepo-baby boss over tea; both of them stole as many packets as would fit in their pockets whenever they entered a hotel room or lobby. 

Their coliving ended abruptly and acrimoniously at the exact moment I was finally able to find a job in Madrid. Thanks to Clara’s sudden departure, I ended up living with my partner after only dating long-distance for a few months. Somehow, that arrangement has worked out up until today.

But after a few months, they’d slowly started to heal their relationship over beers in our local plaza. Both of them knew they were too similar to stay estranged. First David, then later I, met her new husband, yet another immigrant, and eventually, we received an invitation to their house outside of Madrid to celebrate the New Year.

Over the course of the night, I received two baffling questions, and David one.

David’s query came first. He’d been eager to chat with Clara’s mother, whom he’d never met but had heard about over the years. He’d mostly stuck to asking her about Girona, Spain, where she’d lived for the past twenty-some years. I knew he was itching to ask about her pre-immigration life in Russia, but he was forcing himself to hold off. She and her husband had fled the former Soviet Union as political refugees, later sending for her two children. Who knew what sort of memories the wrong question might dredge up?

That tact was one-sided. Within five minutes of hearing he was from Peru, MOTHER asked in heavily accented Spanish, “Coméis gusanos allí, ¿no?” Y’all eat worms there, right?

I saw David’s face fall, and as I took a moment considering whether or not to say anything, MOTHER’s other daughter swept in, scolding her and informing her that Lima was a very cosmopolitan city, thank you very much. MOTHER responded with the dismissive wave popular across the globe with people over fifty that says, Fine, I guess we can’t be intolerant anymore. Soooooreeeey. David spent the rest of the evening up until dinner making it known that he was very familiar with the Russian and Ukrainian singers performing on the Russian New Year’s Eve broadcast, because would someone who ate worms know Zemfira?

Two cups of wine and a celebratory shot of vodka later, Clara’s sister, NAME, delivered my first baffling question. She was a finally-licensed esthetician and had developed her own solution for her boyfriend’s receding hairline. She explained as we sat at the table waiting for Clara to deliver our dinner from the kitchen: why pay for an expensive hair transplant or take pills for life when she could simply paint his hair on?

I’d had trouble maintaining eye contact with BOYFRIEND all night. He was the lone Spaniard at the party and spoke animatedly, but my eye was constantly drawn upward. He’d shaved his head down to stubble, a respectable solution for a receding hairline I myself had implemented years earlier. However, once his esthetician lover had gotten ahold of him, she’d painted him an entirely new hairline with henna tattoos. The color and size were slightly off, and the pattern a bit too regular. It ended up giving his head the effect of one of those 3D hidden images from the nineties. I kept letting my eyes lose focus as he talked about his job WHAT WAS IT, waiting for a dinosaur or dolphin to let itself be known.
        
After explaining the procedure to the table, SISTER turned to me specifically. As the only other balding man there, my opinion was somehow worth more. “Está bien, ¿no?” Too drunk and stupid to simply lie, I stared for a long moment, getting lost in the pattern once again. I took a long drink of wine, hoping someone would say something, but instead we sat in silence until the food arrived.

My second question was after dinner. It once again came from Clara’s mother. There was a moment of silence before she suddenly asked, “Christopher, ¿qué piensas tú de este ‘sueño americano?’” What do you think about this ‘American dream?’

            <h3 class="workContent">Madame Butterfly and Bullets</h3>
            <article class="workContent">
In my mind, there’s an inexorable link between the opera Madame Butterfly and the concept of snipers. I’ve shared this thought every time the musical work has come up in my life since I left the US at age 23. Surprisingly, it has happened several times. And whenever I explain why, it’s led to whoever I’m speaking to looking at me with pity - at least if they’re not from the States.
                
These days, when mass shootings happen in the United States, it’s no longer news where I live in Spain. If it’s a particularly gruesome one, perhaps with children or over twelve casualties, it may be mentioned quickly, in the same way we in the US might mention a moderate tornado in Alabama. It’s simply what happens there. Never on the front page, never the leading story. Most of the time, it’s not even covered. To the Europeans, and I’m sure to the rest of the world, our now daily tragedies no longer warrant air time.
                
***
                
Being an English-speaking copywriter in Madrid, I was hired exclusively for international clients. Why else would they ever need me? Because of that, I often worked in large offices with a significant minority of foreigners sprinkled amongst the natives. When other countries experienced violence: a stabbing in London or a shooting in Paris; my colleagues would rush to the desks of our coworkers to make sure they were okay. If it happened after hours, they’d send frantic messages in our group Whatsapps. Marcel, isn’t your family far from Paris?? Is everyone you know okay?? I’m so sorry. I would give my sympathies as well but in my head I was bitter. I’d told them all my home state, but I didn’t get a single message when twelve people were gunned down at Virginia Beach in 2019, or three years later when three students were killed at my sister’s alma mater. But what did I expect? That wasn’t even the worst shooting at a Virginia university in my lifetime. They knew I was gay, and some of them were too, but they didn’t rush to my desk when 49 people were killed in a gay bar in Orlando. That one was bad enough that it came up hours later at lunch. The only comment directed to me was, Why are you all like that?
                
***
                
October 4th, 2002 was a Friday, and rather than spend the day in school, my sister, Kelly, and I had spent the day with our mother, being dragged through various strip malls in the nearby town of Fredericksburg. While our classes had been mercifully canceled, school still ended up taking up our day as it often did.
                
My mother is a teacher. At that time, she taught middle-school science, which also meant she was a candidate for organizing and chaperoning middle-school dances. This involved a lengthy trip to the grocery store for soda, juice, and various unhealthy snacks, along with the party supply store for balloons, helium, and whatever inflatable directions would correspond with the theme her students had chosen.
                
That’s how we’d spent most of our Friday after school had been canceled. My sister and I were forced from parking lot to parking lot, from box store to box store. Party City could be fun, but my sister was no longer of an age to be dueled with inflatable swords. Any strike against her would no doubt be met with the devastating cruelty only a young teen can muster. And like a typical eleven-year-old, I dreaded the grocery store as the ultimate focus of boredom on this earth. 
                
As the hours crept on - first there was a problem with the helium tank, then a lack of sugar-free beverage options caused us to visit three separate grocery stores - my sister and (mostly) I let our misery be known. “Moooom,” my voice took on that nasally quality that makes child-free adults feel secure in their decisions, “this was supposed to be a free day!”
                
“Because of ‘severe weather,’” my sister had mocked, as we had the whole day.
                
Fauquier County, my hometown, is infamous for closing schools at the mere hint of bad weather. This is generally understood to be due to a family successfully suing the school system when a bus hit a patch of black ice and hit a car a decade earlier. But even by my hometown’s closure-prone standards, this one was a joke. I remember wearing 2001-chic oversized cargo shorts under a perfect sun. There weren’t even fluffy clouds in the sky. We’d had the rear windows open in the minivan on the thirty-minute drive into town. Looking back, it seems obvious that the weather was an excuse to close schools, but my mother disagrees. She thinks the timing was just a coincidence.
                
If you grew up on the East Coast, October 2002 may have nagged at you. If you grew up near Washington DC, there’s a good chance you remember that on October 3rd, 2002 - the day before this school closing - four seemingly random people had been gunned down by snipers in Maryland and DC, only about an hour's drive from Fauquier.
                
I don’t remember hearing about the shootings that day, or the previous ones that occurred sporadically over the past nine months as the shooters made their way from one coast to the other, killing all the while - the classic American road trip turned nightmare. But even to adults watching the news, that was DC and its immediate suburbs - the city. No one seemed worried; we would be saved by the sheer force of our banality. Only the most avid Civil War buffs had ever been interested in Fauquier or the surrounding areas - its only modern point of interest was that Robert Duvall, Tom from The Godfather, had his mansion somewhere in the hills to the north. Celebrity murders didn’t happen here, only the occasional marital dispute that escalated to tragedy or, in a truly momentous year, a meth explosion.
                
The first sign something was wrong that day was the lack of cars trudging their way through the strip mall parking lot. Fredericksburg, just south of Fauquier, is divided into two sections: a charming historic old town founded in 1728, filled with cobblestone streets, dusty bookshops, and boogie craft breweries; and its modern side, dozens of commercial shopping centers connected by a myriad of entrance and exit ramps leading to interstate highway 95. Immediately upon leaving any store, you’re met with the bumper of the midsize SUV in front of you, desperately waiting for your chance to either merge onto a backed-up highway or slide into your next retail destination. So when our minivan coasted easily from one lot to another, crossing a deserted intersection, even an eleven-year-old noticed. 
                
We commented on the lack of traffic as we pulled into Aztlan, a local restaurant. It was a small chain, the type of “Mexican” restaurant with a nearly exclusively Caucasian clientele. As soon as the car stopped, I jumped out the sliding door, not from curiosity, but from hunger. It was late in the afternoon, and I’d spent the last hour and a half complaining of my empty stomach. Even my teenage sister, more reserved and reluctant to communicate in anything beyond a disdainful look, had also voiced her hunger.
                
Even now, I clearly remember the helicopter that hovered above us briefly before speeding off to another much bigger parking lot, just on the other side of a small interior road and island filled with struggling shrubs. The craft joined two more of its brethren, each with a different paint job. As I pointed the police copters out to my family, who couldn’t have possibly missed them regardless, the front doors of the restaurant were thrown open. The hostess, a woman in her late teens, waved at us emphatically. I remember my mother pushing me forward while I was still wondering why this hostess was so enthusiastic in her duties. We were quickly herded through the entrance and into a corner of the restaurant I’d never seen before. This was odd, as we’d visited this restaurant twice a month for the past five years, an eternity if you’re only eleven. There were no windows at this booth. When the waitress came to bring us complimentary chips and salsa, I remember her ducking down as she moved through the restaurant.
                
Later that day, we would learn that the infamous Maryland/DC sniper had made his way down south. At 2:30 pm, a 43-year-old woman leaving Michaels was shot in the chest as she loaded fabric yards and frames into her car. She was a year younger than my mother. The minivan I saw on the news looked exactly like ours. 
                
Much later, we’d learn that the sniper could have only taken the shot from the same lot we’d parked in. 
                
As to our late lunch/early dinner, my memories differ somewhat from my mother's. In her recollection, she’s scared and her children are nervous. She conspires with the waitstaff, trying to gather information. They agree that the safest course of action is to stay inside for now, and as her children are hungry and it is a restaurant, they may as well eat as they shelter in place.
                
In my memories, we are astounded by the theatrics of the people around us. We don’t know there has been a shooting but clearly, something has happened. We doubt it could possibly warrant the reactions around us, ducking waitresses and absent shoppers. We enjoy enchiladas with the firm knowledge that whatever’s happening can’t be that serious. My mother makes a joke saying, “If this is the end, at least it’s a good last meal.”
                
I’m not sure which of our memories is more accurate, and how much was my mother attempting to shield me from her very real fear. But I did bring up that we left after our meal as we normally would, not staying inside where it was presumably safe. My mother audibly shrugged on the phone, saying simply “We were done with our meal.” When I insist that I remember it being more or less a normal meal in our minds, rather than an emergency shelter she responds simply, “I mean, we were really hungry.”
                
***
                
As the three of us arrived to school the following Monday, another victim was shot in the chest, this time a thirteen-year-old in Maryland, also arriving at school. The Death tarot card was found next to a shell casing where the shot had been taken. A message was written on it: Call me God. 
                
After that, there was a feeling that the wrath of God had fallen on us. No one spent any time outside beyond the absolutely necessary, exactly as the shooters wanted as they continued to spread death around the area: murdering a man on my father’s route to work, another at the gas station we always used before long trips to my grandma’s house. They had a talent for striking during the most mundane scenes, murdering and wounding in the margins of the daily routine we all find ourselves in: pumping gas, mowing the lawn, arriving at work. In a shopping center parking lot. Any time you went outside, you wondered if a sniper’s cross was trained on you.
                
At school, our gym periods were held inside indefinitely. The one plus was that we were no longer forced to run the mile. Instead, we trudged in a circle around the athletic children playing volleyball or H.O.R.S.E., grateful our gymnasium had no windows. All trips were canceled, including a planned visit to the DC Opera House to see Madame Butterfly. I still don’t know what the play is actually about.
                
The shooters were arrested at the end of October. Most people remember the local shootings going on for at least three months, but the reality was much shorter. But even after seeing their faces on the news, knowing those particular shooters were detained, it took time to shake the unease of going outside. I’m not sure I ever did completely.
                
***
                
For years, that’s what I would talk about on the rare occasion Madame Butterfly came up: I’d start with the DC sniper and the resulting missed field trip and sometimes segway into other anecdotes: a rifle being drawn at my mother, sister, and I simply because we’d passed another car on a country road; my sister’s voicemail being full of messages when a maniac killed 32 people at a neighboring university because our out-of-state relatives never bothered to learn the name of her college. My non-American audience would generally listen incredulously at the nonchalant way I spoke of such things. They didn’t understand how lucky I was - I’d only been threatened with a gun twice in my life. I didn’t know anyone who’d been killed by a gun. I was rare. 
                
More recently, I was sharing this association with a friend from the States, one who’s known me since middle school. We’d been talking on a Whatsapp voice call, and I mentioned that a coworker going to the opera had triggered my DC sniper ramblings. They stopped me quickly with a question: what class in the sixth grade would have taken me to see Madame Butterfly? I clucked my tongue, dismissive in a way you can only get away with with people that love you, “That wasn’t sixth grade, it was fifth. My elementary school was going.” My friend stood firm, they remembered the year in detail. We’d been in sixth grade during the shootings. After a few minutes wracking my brain, it clicked. In sixth grade, they’d canceled our trip to the Natural History Museum because of the DC sniper. In fifth grade they’d canceled our trip to the Washington Opera House because of 9-11. 
                
“I can’t believe it,” I sputtered into the phone. “I’ve been bringing up the wrong terrorists every time someone mentions that damn play! For years!”
                
I could almost hear my friend shrug over the phone. “Eh, I get it. At a certain point, it all runs together.”
                
***
                
These days, like many people who visit the United States from Europe, I’m worried about gun violence while I’m there. I suppose it’s inevitable when mass shootings are a daily occurance. 
                
The first time I took my partner to the US, we started in New York City before making our way to Virginia. I’d warned him about potential problems with border control and what to do if he was ever stopped by police, but I hadn’t said much about a shooter. What would I be able to tell him, anyway? In our first hour in the city, we were walking from Central Park to a Shake Shack on Broadway. I’d turned to take another look at 423 Park Avenue, truly one of New York’s ugliest buildings, when he suddenly gasped in fear. My arm shot out to his shoulder as my breathing stopped. I knew we shouldn’t have come here. I knew that the constant violence would inevitably catch up with me. And now David would pay for it too. But as I looked past him, I didn’t see any scenes of carnage.
                
“What is it?” I forced myself to ask softly, almost in a whisper.
                
“¡Mira!” Look! He was pointing to three enormous rats gathered together over a paper plate of spaghetti.
                
“Jesus,” I sighed, letting go to slap him lightly on the arm. “You scared me. Pensaba que hubo un problema de verdad.” I thought we had a real problem.
                
He asked me what I meant, but I just shrugged. We crossed the street to avoid the gang of rats and kept walking. I didn’t want him to think I’d brought him somewhere unsafe.

            <h3 class="workContent">By Any Other Name</h3>
            <article>
Being called a faggot is much more memorable in a foreign country. Of course, there’s the shock of hearing such a familiar word in such a strange accent. There’s the disbelief that the homophobia you grew up with has followed you across an ocean. And of course, it raises questions of how these foreigners (actually no, you are the foreigner) were able to clock you so quickly. 
                
Apparently, my faggotry is strong enough to cross all cultural and linguistic barriers.

Pédé (Ped-deh) - This French slur roughly translates to faggot. That’s what was shouted at me the first time I was hate-crimed outside of the USA. Here at least, there was no element of wondering how they’d known. At age nineteen, I was making out with another gay teenager on a public street in Montreal when the word was shouted at us. 
                
The nice thing about pédé is that to an English speaker, it’s not the most obvious version in French (see Fagot, pg 16). And of course, in the land of “bonjour-hi,” the classic double-g Anglo-version (see faggot, pg 23) was always on the table as well. The less nice thing about pédé, beyond being a homophobic slur, is that it’s short for pédofile, which I don’t believe requires a translation. The association across the West - and most likely beyond, I’m simply not well-traveled enough to know - of homosexuals and pedophilia is in my mind one of the most devastating and damaging aspects of homophobia. To this day, I wonder how I will be perceived whenever I’m around children.
                
The word being hurled at us from a group of middle-aged men across le Boulevard de Maisonneuve was particularly ironic because both I and the other boy were barely legal adults. Neither of us could drink in our home country – he was also American, escaping the cold racism of Boston for the colder, just as racist winter in Montreal for a semester. 
                
I didn’t know the word, but I could guess the meaning from the slurred words and cruel laughter as we drunkenly, enthusiastically explored each others’ tongues, in plain view of the street. It was late, one or two a.m., on a weekday in March. When I arrived with two friends who were waiting for me back at the hostel, the locals had commented how lucky we were, we’d arrived in a heat wave, enjoying nights of up to eight degrees Fahrenheit (that’s thirteen below zero for those of you lucky enough to be born outside of the States). So, when the yells began, I simply pulled the other boy closer, deeper into the thick wool topcoat with irregular buttons I’d bought on clearance from Burlington Coat Factory. I refused to let them break the moment, one I’d waited years for.
                
As embarrassing as it is to admit, that was this faggot’s first time kissing a man, my first time kissing anyone beyond a quick peck to try to prove to myself that I was in fact interested in girls. I was nineteen. I’d spent my first semester at a small college in Virginia alternating between desperately trying to find another gay man to make out with, desperately trying to drown out the anxieties of school and a sick mother with alcohol and marijuana, and desperately trying to pass my classes. I had largely succeeded at the latter two, but by March had still failed completely at the former. 
                
So, when I’d had the chance to escape to Montreal for a week during spring break with two friends, both queer, one nearly as sexually limited as myself at that time, the other in a relationship stable enough she was starting to get bored, I immediately agreed. After a twenty-hour drive - we had two wrong turns, one into the DC Capitol Lawn, the other mistakenly crossing the Brooklyn Bridge - we’d spent the day wandering through cold, historic streets. We noted the rainbow flags that hung on many of the shops and cafés, and, as the sun set, we saw the streets begin to fill with other queer young people. 
                
I’d found this particular boy on my own after my friends had headed back to the hostel. Jill, one of my oldest friends, didn’t want me to explore on my own. We’d been drinking and smoking copious amounts of weed with a friendly girl in our hostel who’d brought her supplies from Vancouver. But Sara, a much more recent friend, had spent the previous semester smoking and drinking with me in the woods behind their dorm and supported me in my insistence that I would be fine. I was young enough to have been allowed to enter a male strip club without any cover charge and left alone in the corner even when I ordered nothing and didn’t give a single tip. But somehow, rather than ending up with one of the many older men there, I exited with this particular boy, the same age and nearly as sexually inexperienced as I was.
                
I’m not giving him a name simply because I no longer remember it. He’s not a real person that way, just the first boy I kissed. What I do remember is how small he seemed. Taller than me - to be fair, hardly a feat - he was rail thin, he must have weighed less than 115 lbs (about 52 kgs). Still, he didn’t hesitate when he heard the words they hurled against us like a weapon. I had pulled him deeper into my thick wool coat, but he broke free, like a diver coming up for air. He shouted something in French into the air, not even bothering to turn his head to look at the gang of three or four grown men glowering at us from the opposite corner. 
                
Whatever he’d said was strong enough to elicit a reaction. I chuckled nervously as the men’s shouts grew louder, angrier. It wasn’t until I heard the sound of broken glass that I realized we had a real problem. 
                
We both looked up at the crash, shards of glass rained down on our shoes, the bottle had shattered against the curve only a foot away from us. “Holy shit!” I don’t know if I was speaking or hearing him in that moment. Another bottle was flying towards us.
                
We ran, laughing, across historic cobblestones as threats I couldn’t understand and more sounds of exploding glass followed us. 
                
We probably only went one block before we felt secure in our escape. I leaned in for another kiss. I’d spent my first year of college sporadically running from the police. Being attacked felt the same - just another small thrill to break up the tedium of life. We were there another half hour, only kissing, before we went our separate ways. Neither of us had somewhere to go. 
                
That particular boy texted me the next day saying he would try and return to the same bar, but he wasn’t sure he’d be free. It was my last night in Montreal. I went to the club anyway, only for him to confirm he wouldn’t make it. Upon leaving, I discovered my coat had been stolen from the coat check. I walked back to the hostel in the cold, thinking about how much I loved the city of Montreal.
                
Fagot (Fah-gote) - You’ll have to imagine this one in a French accent. Like all things in French, it somehow sounds more intimidating and a touch ridiculous at the same time.

The first time I heard that word in French, I was studying abroad in Vienna, Austria. I’d been convinced to go to a nightclub with friends, or at least friendly acquaintances in my building. The club we went to was known for bad techno, a young international crowd, and a cheap vending machine with beer next to the dance floor. 
                
Like most white Americans, I’m not a confident dancer. But, like most adult gay men, I’ve developed enough confidence to be able to get through a wedding or a few hours in the club without too much embarrassment. However, at age twenty-one, I was awkward, particularly on the dance floor. I had one left foot in the closet and one left foot out. I’d told a few close friends I was gay and was convinced the world would implode around me should anyone else discover it. Thus, I was always hesitant to approach men, even ones I suspected of being gay. I was awkward in my body, unsure of how or where to move. On the rare occasion a girl danced near me, I became uncomfortable, completely unsure of how to play it. In retrospect, I’m sure those young women were very aware I was gay and just wanted me to have a good time. 
                
Perhaps it was the European ambiance, perhaps it was the cheap bottle of rosé I’d drank alone before leaving our building, but on this night I was finally able to dance. I moved freely, if gracelessly, in my small circle of friends, reveling in the terrible music and soulless movement that is dancing with white Europeans.
                
Soon enough, my group began to couple off. I was the odd man out that night, as I usually was. But I’d still enjoyed the evening and went to get one final beer from the machine before disappearing into the night, as was my want.
                
Before I knew what was happening, I was surrounded. A group of young men, four or five, had me surrounded, two in front, two behind me. I vaguely recognized them, they were also exchange students at the same university. I was fairly sure the tallest one had been kicked off a train for assaulting other students on a day trip.
                
“Putain de fagot!”
                
I froze, more surprised than angry or scared. This was exactly what I’d been worried about, and it had happened so quickly. I should have known better than to think I could just dance as I wanted. It didn’t matter that I hadn’t even gotten to dance with a man, just the act of moving revealed me to the world. Only one time, and everyone could see. That’s just how gay I was. 
                
“Fuck you!” One of the giant, lovely Polish men in my group appeared from out of nowhere. He didn’t bother to push any of the offending party; years of ice hockey and being a muscular six-foot-two man allowed him to simply walk through them. They scattered quickly as my Polish classmate, I believe it was Pawel but it may have been Andrez, yelled something to them in French.
                
When they were gone, he turned to me as if nothing had happened and asked if I had a euro for him to borrow for the beer machine. I did and decided to dance a bit more as we drank our lukewarm beers.

Marica (Ma-reek-ah) - Interestingly enough, this is the only version of faggot that’s not an insult, even ironically.

The word historically translates to faggot across the Spanish-speaking world, but interestingly, among a large portion of millennial and Gen-Z Colombia and Venezuela, has come to have a very different meaning: dude, bro, or pal. 
                
Take a moment to imagine it, a group of thirty-something straight men all headed to a soccer game: - Faggot, I can’t believe you left your wallet at home! You owe me so many beers! - Relax, faggot, you know I’m good for it. And it’s not just men, across Latin America you can hear plenty of women: Faggot, he called you?! I knew he would, he was looking at you all night! And back in the student days, the ubiquitous: Ay faggot, I’m going to fail this exam.
                
As an actual faggot not from the marica-speaking region of the world, this was very confusing to me when I began living with Venezuelans.
                
My roommate in Buenos Aires was studying in the same program as I was. We lived together to save money. There was supposed to be a third roommate, but just after the two of us signed a contract, his father was struck blind and he had to cancel his studies to support his family. At least, that’s what his Facebook message said. So, Samuel, a Venezuelan man a couple years younger than I was, and I had to fill our third room. Over the course of the year, we had several different occupants including a Finnish girl who became his long-term girlfriend, a Venezuelan girl who became his nemesis, an aspiring professional chef from Medellín, one of my oldest friends, a Turkish doctor, and his mother. With the exception of his mother, Samuel referred to many of them as “marica.” 
                
In the same Facebook group after our absentee roommate left, Samuel had asked me if I was gay worryingly quickly - within twenty minutes of my first message. Wary after being raised in rural Virginia, I responded yes. Samuel replied that he was straight, but that there was no problem and still wanted to be roommates. He just liked proving that he had great gaydar.
                
The ‘maricas’ arrived as soon as he did. Whenever a friend came, which was often; he spoke on the phone; or we had a new temporary roommate, they would all be marica. For the first few weeks, I didn’t notice - I had studied enough Spanish to know maricón, but I had never heard this version of the slur. And my Spanish was bad enough at this point I could barely track conversations anyway.
                
When I did notice and asked, I was quickly informed that the word had evolved. It was now simply a way to refer to a friend, like che, tío, or dude. This was backed up by numerous other Colombians and Venezuelans in our program. 
                
It wasn’t until weeks later, when I was speaking Spanish fluently and had an Argentine boyfriend, that I noticed something. Neither I nor boyfriend were ever marica. I was gringo or Yankee, Juan was simply Juan. It seemed that if you were truly a maricón, you could never be a marica. But Samuel was generous with his pot and the delicious dinners he enjoyed cooking, and I was busy with my new relationship, new studies, and trying to keep up with the constantly shifting political and economic drama that was, and has always been, the background noise of life in Buenos Aires.
                
Just before his mother arrived in the city for a month, Samuel and I were sitting on the roof of our building. I was the first to climb the utility ladder and discover a perfect view from our fourteen-story building - flashing lights and concrete from the edge of the river Plata and as far as you could see in every other direction. He passed me a joint as we watched fifteen million people hustling for their dreams below us, and then he asked me for a favor while his mother was here.
                
He inhaled deeply before asking, smoke billowed out along with his words, “¿puedes fingir de no ser gay? Solo en frente de mi mamá.” Can you pretend to not be gay? Just with my mom. 
                
I froze, and I’m sure my eyebrow shot up. I was surprised. Samuel had spent time with Juan and I together, he’d introduced me to his own gay and lesbian friends, he’d even been my wingman at a gay bar. I took the joint passed to me and breathed in deeply. “Y cuando está Juan?” And when Juan’s here? I knew my answer already, but I wanted to hear what he’d say.
                
He switched to English, “He can just be your friend - just when she’s here.”
                
Juan was my first real boyfriend and my second official one. I’d spent high school in the closet, first trying to convince myself I was in love with a female friend who would have been far too good for me had I actually been interested, then later that a straight friend could be something more. In college, every party was an obsessive mission to find a man that almost always ended in failure. In short, I’d spent half my life searching for the boyfriend I finally had.
                
“No,” I answered without hesitation. 
                
“Pero solo cuando ella–”
                
“Absolutamente no. No chance.” I said it calmly but with no space for argument. I took a third hit of the joint he’d rolled - his weed. It was a faux pas, but he deserved a bit of disregard. He nodded and neither of us said much else as we watched the sun set over the megalopolis.
                
Later, I heard him on the phone as I prepared to meet my boyfriend. “No sé qué le pasa a esa marica. Dice que no y ya.”
                
I didn’t stop. I would either be right on time or dreadfully late, depending on the incredibly erratic city bus. But I did wonder as I headed out into the city, did that word still mean dude?
                
Puto (Poo-toe) - Spanish students may recall that the feminine puta is generally translated as bitch. It’s an insulting way to refer to a female sex worker. The male version, puto, can be used as a vulgar way to refer to male prostitutes but is more often a general slur for homosexuals. 
                
When I lived in Buenos Aires, I couldn’t afford a working smartphone. The one I’d had in the States still worked for a few hours at a time but without any data. I navigated the huge city with screenshots from Google Maps and frequently asking passersby for directions, simultaneously practicing my nascent Spanish. I was frequently lost. As I only had a few hours of class a week, I generally leaned into my wanderings, walking aimlessly and turning any time I sensed I was entering an area with excessive pickpockets or one of the famed vías miserias, slums that had been ravaged by a new crack variant called paco.
                
While I had very little money, I had one vice that I still spent money on. I drank, but only socially, and had so mastered the art of pregaming and drinking cheaply that I didn’t count that habit against me. Marijuana was given to me freely, if sporadically, in exchange for me rarely complaining about the noise and filth left behind by my roommate’s frequent visitors. No, my true vice that shamed me whenever I glanced at my budget was iced coffee. I made my coffee at home, but far too often I was tempted into a Starbucks for a second or third cup. 
                
One day, I was particularly lost, walking slowly through an area rife with construction, like much of the city. It was a balmy December day, the humid air drifted in from the river and smelled like sweat with a hint of sewage. 
                
“Ey, che. Dame un trago.” Hey man, give me a sip. I looked up incredulously. The construction worker was looking at me. I paused, sure that I misunderstood. 
                
Since arriving, people had asked me for a drink of water, usually on the metro, and generally, the requests came from men who appeared to be homeless. If I had a disposable bottle, I’d give it to them. If not, I judged on how thirsty they seemed. The truly desperate would receive my metal bottle. I’d give them as many swigs as they wanted, then leave the rest untouched, carefully washing the bottle at home before using it again. 
                  
This man was different. He seemed thirsty, working in the heat, but he was working. Nothing stopped him from buying his own iced coffee. I wondered if this was some form of flirting, but the only desire I saw on the man’s face was for frigid caffeine.
                
“No,” I finally replied and started walking again. I may have added a perfunctory “Perdón.”
                
I heard the slur from behind me as I kept moving, “Puto!”
                
I couldn’t help laughing as I glanced back to make sure I wasn’t being followed. The worker had already turned back to his task. He wasn’t, necessarily, a bigot. He just really wanted to have some iced coffee. 
                
As a faggot, I can relate to that.
